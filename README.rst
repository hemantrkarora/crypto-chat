CRYPTO CHAT
===================================
This is a chat application that uses Hill Cipher. User enters a 2x2 matrix as key. The plaintext message is encrypted using this key and sent to the server. It is received by other users in the same room as a ciphertext. It is decrypted using the receiver's key. If the sender and receiver keys are same, the receiver can get the same message in plaintext else he/she cannot infer the message.

Django-chatrooms has been used.
